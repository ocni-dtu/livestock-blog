# LIVESTOCK

Welcome to the Livestock package documentation!

Livestock is the name of the pluging for Grasshopper, that has been developed for the thesis of Christian Kongsgaard.

**What can Livestock do?**
* Livestock enables the user to calculate outdoor thermal comfort where the evapotranspiration of vegetation is taken into account.
* Livestock includes a wrapper around the [Catchment Modelling Framework (CMF)](http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/cmf/), 
which is a CPython library to create and compute hydrological models.
* With CMF and Livestock it is possible to make hydrological models directly in Grasshopper and therefore study 
surface run-off, soil infiltration etc. Which can be used in Storm Water Management.  

Livestock consists of a series of Grasshopper Python Script components and a underlying collection of Python scripts and a PyPI package.

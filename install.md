# Install Livestock

Livestock is a plugin to [Grasshopper](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/) for [Rhino](https://www.rhino3d.com/). 
It is therefore an requirement that those two programs are installed for it to work. If they are install it 
should be pretty straight forward to install the rest.

**To Install**:
* In Grasshopper, choose File > Special Folders > Components folder. Save the gha file there.
* Right-click the file > Properties > make sure there is no "blocked" text
* Restart Rhino and Grasshopper

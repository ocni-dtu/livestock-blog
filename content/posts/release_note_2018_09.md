Summary: Announcement and release notes for Livestock 2018.09

I am really happy to announce the first public release of Livestock. So far Livestock has only existed as a biproduct 
of my [master thesis]({filename}/pages/portfolio.md), but over the summer I have worked hard on streamlining the 
workflow to make it more user-friendly. That also means that the number of components have gone down compared to what 
was part of the thesis, in order to focus on improving a subset of components and functionalities. However, the plan 
is to release all the components from my thesis, but it have to wait for a later release. Livestock is hereby moved 
from the "alpha-phase" into "beta" as I expect there is still some bugs crawling around. If you encounter any please 
create an [Github Issue](https://github.com/livestock3d/livestock/issues) and I will try to fix it as soon as possible.
 
[Kristoffer Negendahl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristoffernegendahl/) has gone from being my thesis supervisor to an 
more active, but equally valuable, part of the team. He has, besides counselling, been the first tester of Livestock 
and used it at his day job at [BIG](https://big.dk).
